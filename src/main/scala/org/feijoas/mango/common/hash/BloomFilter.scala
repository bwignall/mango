/**
 * A Bloom filter for instances of `T`. A Bloom filter offers an approximate containment test
 *  with one-sided error: if it claims that an element is contained in it, this might be in error,
 *  but if it claims that an element is <i>not</i> contained in it, then this is definitely true.
 *
 *  <p>From the Guava <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/HashingExplained/">BloomFilter tutorial</a>:
 *  {{{
 *  implicit object PersonFunnel extends Funnel[Person] {
 *     override def funnel(from: Person, into: PrimitiveSink) = ...
 *  }
 *
 *  val friends: BloomFilter[Person] = BloomFilter.create(500, 0.01)
 *  friendsList.foreach { case p: Person => friends.put(p) }
 *
 *  // much later
 *  if (friends.mightContain(dude)) {
 *     // the probability that dude reached this place if he isn't a friend is 1%
 *     // we might, for example, start asynchronously loading things for dude while we do a more expensive exact check
 *  }
 *
 *  }}}
 *
 *  <p>The false positive probability (`FPP`) of a bloom filter is defined as the probability
 *  that `#mightContain(T)` will erroneously return `true` for an object that
 *  has not actually been put in the `BloomFilter`.
