/**
 * Statistics about the performance of a [[Cache]]. Instances of this class are immutable.
 *
 *  <p>Cache statistics are incremented according to the following rules:
 *
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>When a cache lookup encounters an existing cache entry `hitCount` is incremented.
 *  <li>When a cache lookup first encounters a missing cache entry, a new entry is loaded.
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>After successfully loading an entry `missCount` and `loadSuccessCount` are
 *     incremented, and the total loading time, in nanoseconds, is added to
 *     `totalLoadTime`.
 *  <li>When an exception is thrown while loading an entry, `missCount` and `loadExceptionCount`
 *     are incremented, and the total loading time, in nanoseconds, is
 *     added to `totalLoadTime`.
 *  <li>Cache lookups that encounter a missing cache entry that is still loading will wait
 *     for loading to complete (whether successful or not) and then increment `missCount`.
 *  </ul>
 *  <li>When an entry is evicted from the cache, `evictionCount` is incremented.
 *  <li>No stats are modified when a cache entry is invalidated or manually removed.
 *  <li>No stats are modified on a query to `Cache#getIfPresent`.
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  <p>A lookup is specifically defined as an invocation of one of the methods
 *  `LoadingCache#get(key)`,
 *  `Cache#get(key, loader)`, or `LoadingCache#getAll(keys)`.
